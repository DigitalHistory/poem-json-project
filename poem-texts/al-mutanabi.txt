My Heart is Aflame
Al-Mutanabi

When the lion bares his teeth, do not 
fancy that the lion shows to you a smile. 
I have slain the man that sought my heart's blood many a time. 
Riding a noble mare whose back none else may climb, 
Whose hind and fore-legs seem in galloping as one 
Nor hand nor foot requireth she to urge her on. 
And O the days when I have swung my fine-edged glaive 
Amidst a sea of death where wave was dashed on wave! 
The desert knows me well, the night, the mounted men, 
The battle and the sword, the paper and the pen
