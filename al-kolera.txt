Cholera (al-kolera)
Nazik al-Mala’ika (trans. Robyn Creswell)

The night is still.
Listen to the beat of lamentations
Deep in the dark, beneath the silence, for the dead.
Cries that rise and clash against each other,
Sadness that drowns then catches fire,
    Wails that stumble over their own echoes.
Every heart is fevered,
Every home is full of sorrow,
Everywhere a soul screams in the dark,
    Everywhere a voice cries out,
    This is what death has torn apart.
    Death, death, death
O sadness of the Nile weeping at the work of death.

Dawn is risen.
Listen to the tread of mourners
In the dawn’s silence. Look and listen to the grieving parade.
Ten dead, twenty,
Too many to count. Listen to those who weep,
   Listen to the sound of the poor child.
The dead, the numberless dead,
The dead with no tomorrow.
Everywhere the bereaved wail over corpses
   Without memorial, without peace.
   Such is the work of death
   Death, death, death
Mankind wails and wails at what death has done.

Cholera
In a cave of terror and corpses,
In the cruel, eternal silence where death is the only cure,
The plague of cholera wakes.
Hungry for vengeance, it drives implacably
   Down into the bright, happy valley.
It shrieks in crazed confusion,
Heedless of lamentations.
Its claws leave marks everywhere.
   At home in the peasant woman’s hut
   There is nothing but screams of death.
   Death, death, death
Death takes its vengeance wearing the mask of cholera.

The silence is bitter.
No sound but plaintive echoes.
Even the gravedigger lies in his grave. No succor.
The mosque’s muezzin is no more.
Who will eulogize the dead?
    Nothing but wails and lamentation.
The child without mother or father
Cries with a fevered heart
And soon evil will certainly snatch him away.
   O specter of cholera, you leave behind nothing
   But the cries of the dead.
   Death, death, death
O Egypt, I am shattered by what death has done.
